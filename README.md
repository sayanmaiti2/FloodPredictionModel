Machine Learning Flood Prediction Model

This is a flood prediction model that uses Machine Learning to predict the probability of flood based on the weekly rainfall data. This model is specifically tuned to the West Bengal sub-division of the Indian Subcontinent. 
However, this can be modified to work with other sub-divisions just as well.

The dataset used here doesn't have any information regarding flood occurence, so the rainfall data of the years when flood has occured (http://wbdmd.gov.in/pages/flood2.aspx
), has been used. Using those rainfall data, we create and populate the flood attribute. This is flood attribute is used as the dependent variable in the ML model.
